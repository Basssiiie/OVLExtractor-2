OVL Extractor 2.0
==============

This repository contains the source code from the RCT3 tool OVL Extractor (2.0). Although this code is a bit better than the Park CleanUp code, it still contains lots of memory leaks and bad error handling etc. Though, this source might be useful for people experimenting with the RCT3 file formats.
